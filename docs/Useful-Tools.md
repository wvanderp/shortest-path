## LibreOffice Calc

Editing the TSV files is a precise endeavor. LibreOffice Calc can help with this.
Just open the TSV file in Calc, make your edits, and export it back to TSV. Calc will handle the tab delimiters and quoting for you.

Calc is also handy for sorting the files by a specific column, e.g. sorting by `Skills` to make it easier to find duplicates or missing entries. by default the sorting is lexicographical, meaning `10 Agility` comes before `9 Agility`. To fix this do the following:

- select the column you want to sort by
- go to `Data -> Sort...`
- Extend the selection
- in the window that pops up go to the `Options` tab
- check `enable natural sort`
